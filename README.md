# ‚ö´ Introduction
- This project is using 2 demos:
  1. `demo-db-to-kafka`: which produce students data from a database into the Kafka topic `student`.
  2. `demo-kafka-to-db`: which consume students data from `student` topic and insert them into another database.

- For each seconds, 5 students data are sent from source DB to Kafka topic in one batch, then inserted into another DB from the topic.
- **On the left**: a consumer listening to data sent.
- **On the right**: destination database inserting consumed data.
