# ‚ö´ Introduction
- This project is using 2 demos:
  1. `demo-db-to-kafka`: produces students data from a database into a Kaka topic.
  2. `demo-kafka-to-db`: consumes students data from the same topic and insert them into another database.
- For each second, 5 students data are sent from `source` database to the Kafka topic `student` in one batch, then the batch is inserted into `destination` database as soon as data is consumed from the topic.
- **The left window**: a consumer listening to data sent.
- **The right window**: destination database inserting consumed data.
